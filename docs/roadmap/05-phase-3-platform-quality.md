# Phase 3: Platform Quality

**Testing policy:** Every new `feature/*` or `fix/*` branch should include tests for the new work. These tests are recommended for confidence but are not required to merge into `main` unless explicitly called out.

## 16). `feature/account-lockout`
    - Failed login tracking and temporary lockouts

## 17). `feature/refresh-tokens-rotation`
    - Refresh tokens with rotation strategy

## 18). `feature/token-revocation-introspection`
    - Revocation + introspection endpoints

## 19). `feature/admin-app-management`
    - Internal admin UI for client registration + secrets
