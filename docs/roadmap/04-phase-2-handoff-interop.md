# Phase 2: Handoff & Interop (External Apps)

**Testing policy:** Every new `feature/*` or `fix/*` branch should include tests for the new work. These tests are recommended for confidence but are not required to merge into `main` unless explicitly called out.

## 14). `feature/external-redirect-handoff`
   - Token handoff or code exchange for SPA client

## 15). `feature/session-to-token-exchange`
   - Convert first-party session to OIDC tokens
