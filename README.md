# ManuMu Studio Authentication

Central authentication and OAuth/OIDC service for ManuMu Studio applications.

**Version:** 1.9.0
**Runtime:** Next.js 15 App Router · TypeScript 5.9 · NextAuth v4 · Prisma 6 · PostgreSQL
**Production URL:** [auth.manumustudio.com](https://auth.manumustudio.com)

## Current Capabilities

- Credentials sign-in with bcrypt password hashing.
- Google and GitHub sign-in through NextAuth for already-linked active accounts.
- Six-digit OTP email verification with resend cooldown and auto-login.
- Enumeration-resistant password-reset request flow.
- JWT sessions with user ID and role claims.
- Profile, password, connected-account, onboarding, and account-deletion UI.
- OAuth client registry with exact redirect URI and allowed-origin lists.
- Authorization Code flow with consent, mandatory PKCE S256, access tokens, and ID tokens.
- OIDC discovery, JWKS, UserInfo, and RP-initiated logout.
- Prisma migrations for PostgreSQL and Neon-compatible deployment.
- Packet 02 invite-gated registration foundation: account status lifecycle (INACTIVE/ACTIVE/SUSPENDED/DELETED), invite lifecycle service with hash-only token storage, atomic invite registration and activation service, QStash-ready transactional email outbox worker with claim-token fencing and encrypted invite delivery, immutable audit events, registration-session handles, admin MFA factor state, Cloudflare Turnstile verification, shared admission helpers, and seven-surface rate-limit wiring.

## Security Controls

The following hardening controls are active in production:

- Upstash Redis rate limiting is required and fail-closed; the app refuses to start without it.
- Packet 02 admission helpers add shared Turnstile verification, CSRF/parity helpers, and independent limiter dimensions for registration, invite redemption, login, password reset, OTP verify, fragment exchange, and admin operations.
- Packet 02 outbox delivery uses an internal worker route with fail-closed bearer-secret auth, admission limiter wiring, claim-token fencing, encrypted invite payloads, and fragment-only invite links.
- Social sign-in hardening: unlinked OAuth first sign-in and silent same-email account linking are denied; explicit account linking is reserved for a future ceremony.
- PKCE S256 is mandatory for every authorization request; `plain` is rejected.
- Authorization codes are consumed atomically, preventing replay races.
- Verification OTPs are stored as HMAC-SHA256 keyed with `OTP_HMAC_SECRET`.
- Self-service signup is disabled in production via `SELF_SERVICE_REGISTRATION_ENABLED=false`.
- CI enforces a blocking dependency audit (`pnpm audit --audit-level=high`) and a full-history secret scan.

Remaining work: invite/allowlist runtime flows on top of the new foundation,
explicit social account linking, bcrypt cost increase, observability, and
pairwise subjects. See [Security](docs/SECURITY.md).

Historical security review records live in `docs/audits/` and `docs/incidents/`.

## Architecture

```text
Relying-party application
  -> /oauth/authorize
  -> ManuMu session / credentials / social provider
  -> authorization code
  -> /oauth/token
  -> RS256 access token + optional ID token
  -> JWKS / UserInfo verification
```

Existing relying parties use the same public `sub` (`User.id`). Pairwise
subjects are researched for new clients but are not implemented.

- [Security](docs/SECURITY.md)
- [API contract](docs/api/openapi.yaml)
- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md)

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm prisma:validate
pnpm prisma:migrate
pnpm prisma:deploy
```

Current limitations:

- `pnpm lint` runs ESLint with `--fix`; CI should become read-only.
- Current suite: 19 Vitest files / 220 tests.
- Coverage thresholds and Playwright E2E tests are not configured.
- The `smoke` script targets `/api/healthz`, which will be implemented during
  the LSA parity work.

See [Testing](docs/TESTING.md) and [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Documentation Policy

Living documents describe the current codebase and must be synchronized in
every feature branch:

- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`
- `docs/api/openapi.yaml`
- `docs/roadmap/`
- relevant feature READMEs

Audits, incidents, journal entries, and merged PR documents are point-in-time
records and are not rewritten to make historical claims match current code.
